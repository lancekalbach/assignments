            <p>About Us:</p>
            <p>My name is Lance, I am a student at VSchool. This is one of my many
                projects. I decided to make this website because I enjoy food.
                Although I am defnitely not the best cook in the world, I really
                enjoy cooking. I find it similar to programming, you combine
                a bunch of stuff and in the end you get an amazing result! 
                Feel free to explore my site, there is a meal search, a random meal
                finder, and a meal category list!
